            student studying design at <a href="https://university.taylors.edu.my/en.html" target="_blank" title="Taylor's University">

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I come from Medan city at Indonesia. My zodiac sign is Scorpio and I love to travel and foods. 
            Personally, I'm a sweet tooth, so I prefer <font color="pink">DESSERTS</font> over salty foods. Asking me to choose only 
            one food to eat for the rest of my life or my <i>favourite food</i> is a <b><font color="red">crime</font></b> to me.
            My favorite color is warm colors, like <font color="brown">brown</font> ,<font color="red">red</font>,
            <font color="#FFFDD0">cream</font>, <font color="yellow">yellow</font> and I also love <font color="#FFE5B4">peach</font> color. 

        </p>

        <h3>Hobbies and Dislikes</h3>
        <p>As a part of a design student, I love to draw in my free time, but I also love to read books especially <i>novels and comics</i>,
            particularly in <b>fantasy</b>genre. A hobby that I tend to pick up these days are watching <font color="red">Netflix</font>, it
             could be a <i>K-drama, movies, series, or even cartoons</i>.
        I dislike <font color="green"><b>SCARY</b></font> movies in general, it could be horror or thriller. I could not eat chillis 
        or anything spicy, I'm weak
        in eating those things, you would see me snot and <font color="blue"><i>cry</i></font> when eating. 
        I also hate scary roller coaster that could make my heart leap out of my chest, basically anything that is scary.
        </p>
